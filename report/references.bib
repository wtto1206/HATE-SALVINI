abstract = {Social media now plays a pivotal role in electoral campaigns. Rapid dissemination of information through platforms such as Twitter has enabled politicians to broadcast their message to a wide audience. In this paper, we investigated the sentiment of tweets by the two main presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, along with almost 2.9 million tweets by Twitter users during the 2016 US Presidential Elections. We analyzed these short texts to evaluate how accurately Twitter represented the public opinion and real world events of significance related with the elections. We also analyzed the behavior of over a million distinct Twitter users to identify whether the platform was used to share original opinions and to interact with other users or whether few opinions were repeated over and over again with little inter-user dialogue. Finally, we wanted to assess the sentiment of tweets by both candidates and their impact on the election related discourse on Twitter. Some of our findings included the discovery that little original content was created by users and Twitter was primarily used for rebroadcasting already present opinions in the form of retweets with little communication between users. Also of significance was the finding that sentiment and topics expressed on Twitter can be a good proxy of public opinion and important election related events. Moreover, we found that Donald Trump offered a more optimistic and positive campaign message than Hillary Clinton and enjoyed better sentiment when mentioned in messages by Twitter users.}

    abstract = { The form and functions of political discourse have considerably taken a new orientation with the evolving ways of communication. Twitter is a platform that is increasingly preferred by the political elites for the purpose of gaining public acclaim and propagating political ideologies. The political discourse on Twitter requires a critical attention toward linguistic structures and strategies to uncover the relationship between language and social practices. For this purpose, tweets of two eminent Pakistani political figures are chosen for unmasking a variety of discourse strategies at work from the perspective of critical discourse analysis (CDA) through the socio-cognitive model of ideological square. The analysis uncovers the hidden ideological structures and strategies realized through a number of rhetorical moves in the selected tweets. The cognitive binary of positive self-presentation and negative other-presentation help achieving political domination and legitimization of political actions by controlling the public opinion. The underlying motives vary and are context bound such as the aims to topple a government or to restore public faith in the governance. This research is significant for political discourse analysts as well as the general public, as a means for analytical activism propagated by any CDA inquiry, and paves way for further research in the use of social media platforms for political purposes. }
